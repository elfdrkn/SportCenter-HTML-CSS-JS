## Sport Center
We designed our website based on example visuals. Our page consists of different sections and is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our navbar remains fixed when scrolling the page. When you click on our trainers, you can see their names and specialties. Our map is live, allowing you to reach the location. The BMI calculation buttons are active, and you can view your result by entering your height and weight.

# My Project

This project is designed to help users calculate their BMI and learn about our classes, trainers and purchases.
